These hadoop jobs require you to download a data dump from stack exchange.

You only need to download one of the sites in the BitTorrent file at the above link, not the entire 12GB archive. The examples assume gaming-stack-exchange, but you should be able to use any of them.


Most of these jobs are based off the book MapReduce Design Patterns (O'Reilly 2012). https://github.com/adamjshook/mapreducepatterns
