These hadoop jobs require you to download a data dump from stack exchange.

You only need to download one of them, the examples assume gaming-stack-exchange, but you should be able to use any of them.


Most of these jobs are based off the book MapReduce Design Patterns (O'Reilly 2012). https://github.com/adamjshook/mapreducepatterns
